						<strong>Caring for your fine jewelry</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Your Anouk piece is designed to last a lifetime. However, even though precious metals are very durable, 
						they may still be scratched and damaged. To ensure longevity of your jewelry, we suggest removing it before 
						activities such as lifting weights, rock climbing, swimming, etc. as well as before using strong chemicals (chlorine, bleach, etc.)
					</p>
	 				<p>
						To clean your fine jewelry at home we recommend using a soft toothbrush, warm water and mild soap. 
						For deeper cleaning, youâ€™re welcome to bring your piece to one of our retail locations. We encourage you to have your 
						jewelry checked on a yearly basis to ensure that the settings have not become loose.

						<strong>Warranty/Guarantee</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						We take great care to select the finest quality materials and labour. 
						Anouk designer pieces are manufactured with the utmost attention to detail, and are carefully 
						inspected before leaving our hands. As a courtesy to our clients, we will repair or replace any 
						piece that we find to have been defective as a result of the manufacturing process, at no labour or material cost, 
						for one year from the purchase date.
